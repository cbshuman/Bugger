# Bugger
Bugger is an open-source web-based bugtracking program similar to Bugzilla. The main difference is that:
<ul>
  <li>Bugger is written in Java, making it more accessable to code for</li>
  <li>Bugger's framework (as of 0.4) is build to allow easy access to multiple databases</li>
  <li>Bugger has a front-end (being written as a seperate project) that is more modern, easy to use, and accessible than Bugzilla</li>
</ul>

Bugger right now is in active development and isn't ready for any kind of production enviroment. However Bugger is free to use
and available under an MIT license (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The main goal of Bugger right now is to make it feature complete, and easy to set up. The
Bugger front-end is also under construction, and will be available soon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Bugger. I will try and get ahold of you as soon as I can.
